Note: These shell scripts were written for Ubuntu 18.04
Run at your own risk!

Run shell scripts from home directory (~ or $HOME)
For some reason, it is better to run the warp installation first, ibsimu second.
For IBSimu, the lines at the end of the attached .bashrc file need to be copied into your ~/.bashrc
or the whole file can be copied into the home directory...
